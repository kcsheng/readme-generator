### Readme Generator

This app is a command line utility that is able to display a series of prompts that requests inputs from the user, following which a readme file is generated.

The prompts require input information including 1) projec title, 2) project description, 3) installtion instructions, 4) usage information, 5) contribution guidlines, 6) test instructions, 7) license (which turns into a badge), 8) contact info (github username and email address, in case of inquiry). After all inputs have been provided, the app also generates the Index (as table of contents) under the project description that links each section of infromation included.
