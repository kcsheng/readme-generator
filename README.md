## Readme Generator

This app is a command line utility that is able to display a series of prompts that requests inputs from the user, following which a readme file is generated in the root readme folder.

The prompts require input information from user including 1) project title, 2) project description, 3) installation instructions, 4) usage information, 5) contribution guidelines, 6) test instructions, 7) license (which turns into a badge), 8) contact info (github username and email address, in case of inquiry). After all inputs have been provided, the app also generates the Index (as table of contents) that links to each section of the infromation included.

This app is built upon the npm command line tool [inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
